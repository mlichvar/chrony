.SH NAME
chronyd \- chrony background daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chronyd
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIconfiguration commands\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIchrony\fR is a pair of programs for maintaining the accuracy of computer
clocks. \fBchronyd\fR is a background daemon program that can be started at boot
time.

\fBchronyd\fR is a daemon which runs in background on the
system.  It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the
system's offset relative to other systems, and adjusts the system
time accordingly.  For isolated systems, the user can periodically
enter the correct time by hand (using \fIchronyc\fR).  In either case,
\fBchronyd\fR determines the rate at which the computer
gains or loses time, and compensates for this.

.SH USAGE
\fBchronyd\fR is usually started at boot-time and requires superuser
privileges.

If \fBchronyd\fR has been installed to its default location
\fI@SBINDIR@/chronyd\fR, starting it is simply a matter of entering the
command:

\fI@SBINDIR@/chronyd\fR

Information messages and warnings will be logged to syslog.

If no configuration commands are specified on the command line,
\fBchronyd\fR will read the commands from the configuration file
(default \fI@SYSCONFDIR@/chrony.conf\fR).

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of the options supported by \fBchronyd\fR is included below.

.TP
\fB\-P\fR \fIpriority\fR
On Linux, this option will select the SCHED_FIFO real-time scheduler at the
specified priority (which must be between 0 and 100).  On Mac OS X, this
option must have either a value of 0 (the default) to disable the thread
time constraint policy or 1 for the policy to be enabled.  Other systems do not
support this option.
.TP
.B \-m
This option will lock chronyd into RAM so that it will never be paged out.
This mode is only supported on Linux.
.TP
.B \-n
When run in this mode, the program will not detach itself from the
terminal.
.TP
.B \-d
When run in this mode, the program will not detach itself from the
terminal, and all messages will be sent to the terminal instead of
to syslog.  When \fBchronyd\fR was compiled with debugging support,
this option can be used twice to print also debugging messages.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIconf-file\fR
This option can be used to specify an alternate location for the
configuration file (default \fI@SYSCONFDIR@/chrony.conf\fR).
.TP
.B \-r
This option will reload sample histories for each of the servers being used.
These histories are created by using the \fIdump\fR command in \fIchronyc\fR,
or by setting the \fIdumponexit\fR directive in the configuration file.  This
option is useful if you want to stop and restart \fBchronyd\fR briefly for any
reason, e.g. to install a new version.  However, it should be used only on
systems where the kernel can maintain clock compensation whilst not under
\fBchronyd\fR's control (i.e. Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and Solaris).
.TP
.B \-R
When this option is used, the \fIinitstepslew\fR directive and the
\fImakestep\fR directive used with a positive limit will be ignored. This
option is useful when restarting \fBchronyd\fR and can be used in conjunction
with the \fB-r\fR option.
.TP
.B \-s
This option will set the system clock from the computer's real-time clock or
to the last modification time of the file specified by the \fIdriftfile\fR
directive.  Real-time clocks are supported only on Linux.

If used in conjunction with the \fB-r\fR flag, \fBchronyd\fR will attempt
to preserve the old samples after setting the system clock from
the real time clock (RTC).  This can be used to allow \fBchronyd\fR to
perform long term averaging of the gain or loss rate across system
reboots, and is useful for dial-up systems that are shut down when
not in use.  For this to work well, it relies on \fBchronyd\fR having
been able to determine accurate statistics for the difference
between the RTC and system clock last time the computer was on.

If the last modification time of the drift file is later than the current time
and the RTC time, the system time will be set to it to restore the time when
\fBchronyd\fR was previously stopped.  This is useful on computers that have no
RTC or the RTC is broken (e.g. it has no battery).
.TP
\fB\-u\fR \fIuser\fR
This option sets the name of the system user to which \fBchronyd\fR will switch
after start in order to drop root privileges.  It overrides the \fBuser\fR
directive from the configuration file (default \fB@DEFAULT_USER@\fR).

On Linux, \fBchronyd\fR needs to be compiled with support for the \fBlibcap\fR
library.  On Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD and Solaris \fBchronyd\fR forks into two
processes.  The child process retains root privileges, but can only perform a
very limited range of privileged system calls on behalf of the parent.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR \fIlevel\fR
This option configures a system call filter when \fBchronyd\fR is compiled with
support for the Linux secure computing (seccomp) facility. In level 1 the
process is killed when a forbidden system call is made, in level -1 the SYSSIG
signal is thrown instead and in level 0 the filter is disabled (default 0).

It's recommended to enable the filter only when it's known to work on the
version of the system where \fBchrony\fR is installed as the filter needs to
allow also system calls made from libraries that \fBchronyd\fR is using (e.g.
libc) and different versions or implementations of the libraries may make
different system calls.  If the filter is missing some system call,
\fBchronyd\fR could be killed even in normal operation.
.TP
.B \-q
When run in this mode, chronyd will set the system clock once
and exit.  It will not detach from the terminal.
.TP
.B \-Q
This option is similar to \fB\-q\fR, but it will only print the offset and
not correct the clock.
.TP
.B \-v
This option displays \fBchronyd\fR's version number to the terminal and exits
.TP
.B \-4
Resolve hostnames only to IPv4 addresses and create only IPv4 sockets.
.TP
.B \-6
Resolve hostnames only to IPv6 addresses and create only IPv6 sockets.
